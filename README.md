# Project Title

This github repository contains all the files and code used to create the project "Bike Accidents: Insights from Machine Learning". The project is divided into 3 main parts: Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis and Visualization and finally a Machine Learning model used to predict the evolution of bike accidents over the years in France.

The aim of this project is to provide a dahsboard made using streamlit that will allow the user to visualize the evolution of bike accidents in France over the years and to predict the number of accidents for the next years.
